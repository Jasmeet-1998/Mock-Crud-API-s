By -> Jasmeet

Description -> Credit Banking System Based Mock API

Major Packages Used

Features and Access
---------------

1.) Admin can fetch anyone Information basically all Users in the DATABASE
 and Approve Loans(get,Approve).

2.) Agent can access their own data and edit,update,get Customer Data.

3.) Customer can only get their own Loan Requests.

NOTE-> Admin can Use Agent Creds to Edit Loan Request this is Not missed by me
I have a Route for Admin to Get Information for all users for Debugging PURPOSES
By removing the Route in the admin.js of routes directory this loophole can be tackled.
